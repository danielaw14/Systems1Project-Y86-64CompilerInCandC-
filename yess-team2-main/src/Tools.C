/*
 * Hints/Notes:
 * 1) Pay attention to what the comments say. 
 * 2) Sometimes a function returns the source input if input validation
 *    fails and sometimes it returns 0.
 * 3) Pay attention to the "rules".
 * 4) You won't get credit for a method if it passes the tests but
 *    breaks the "rules".
 * 5) if the rule is no loops then you cannot use while, do-while, for
 * 6) if the rule is no conditionals then you cannot use if, if-else, 
 *    switch or ternary statements 
 * 7) The last 6 function restrict the operators that can be used. If
 *    used any other operators than those, you will not receive credit.
 * 8) If you shift a variable by an amount that is equal to or
 *    larger than its size, then the shift doesn't happen. For example, 
 *    if n is a 64 bit unsigned int then n >> 64 is n (not 0).
 * 9) If you need a 64 bit constant, you need to follow the constant
 *    by either ul (unsigned long), l (long), ull (unsigned long long),
 *    or ll (long long). For example, 3ul, 3l, 3ull, 3ll are all eight bytes.
 *    By default, 3 without the suffix is a 32 bit int.
 * 10) >> (right shift) shifts off low order bits
 * 11) << (left shift) shifts off high order bits
 * 12) right shift of a signed variable maintains the sign bit; 
 *     right shift of an unsigned variable brings in 0 as the sign bit
 *
